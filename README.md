# A-full-fledged-network-for-an-organization-with-multiple-subnets

Project Statement

University of Professionals, is an enterprise like East West University, owns a large number of
computers, with a complex network infrastructure. Apart from wired internet access to all the
classrooms, labs, employee PCs, library and other administrative and academic wings, the university also
provides wireless internet access for everyone. On top of that the university runs a number of complex
networked systems to support several of its business process like admissions, advising, results, eTender,
library management, accounts and so on. This complex network infrastructure is subnetted and
switching/routing mechanisms are in practice.

Tasks

Your task is to create a complete model of a complex network by discovering the interconnectivity of the
systems and sub networks, which will reflect the University’s structure and facilities, features within the
network will include the followings:
 Web page of the university will reflect University of Professionals’ web page. [done]
 DNS sever needs to be installed to locate webserver - meaning people will browse University’s
web site with the following address: http://www.professionals.edu [done]
 Configure the whole network in such a way that IP for the hosts of different campuses will be
automatically assigned by a single DHCP server. If single DHCP is not doable by you, then use
multiple DHCP servers; however that will discredited. [done, using multi]
 Among the hosts make sure wireless links to the networks are available. [done]
 University’s full network has covered its six campuses with six routers; Connections between the
campus routers are given at the end of handout. [done]
Features to get Bonus!
 Network addresses will be from all 3 classes [done]
 Incorporation of different subnets [done]
